This thesis deals with the development and study of algorithms for
planning optimal motions for anthropomorphic systems, which are
underactuated and highly redundant systems, such as humanoid robots
and digital actors. Randomized motion planners and optimal control
methods are proposed and discussed. A first contribution concerns the
use of an efficient graph search algorithm in order to optimize walk
trajectories that were previously obtained for a bounding-box
representation of the system using randomized motion planners. The
second contribution develops the use of constrained randomized motion
planners in order to plan in a generic way whole-body motions that
involve both walking and manipulation. Finally we develop an
algorithmic approach which combines constrained randomized motion
planners and optimal control methods; this approach allows the
generation of dynamic, fast and collision-free motions for
anthropomorphic systems in the presence of obstacles.
