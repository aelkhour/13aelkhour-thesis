\section{Conclusion}

passive toe walking pattern generator, can small-space still be
applied (Sellouati iros 2006, harada) ?

small-space plus stepping over obstacles.

online stabilizer multiple contact

online controller: plan more roughly, control connects the dots
(uncertainty, funnels, Brock).

planning on a union of manifolds.

optimization: mordatch, multiple contact, auxiliary variables, used as
a local planner for global planning.

Add killer application:
planetary exploration.
how do we need everything done in this thesis and more.
industrial application?
